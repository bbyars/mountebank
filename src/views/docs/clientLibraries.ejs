<h1>Client Libraries</h1>

<p>While mountebank speaks <a href='/docs/api/overview'>REST</a>, he truly loves your native language
and has no desire to make you learn another language.  If you have a native library you'd like others
to be able to use, please send mountebank a note on the <a href='/support'>support page</a> or through
a pull request to this page and he will add it to the list below.</p>

<p>Some of these are still in their early stages.  Feel free to help the authors out ;></p>

<h1>Orchestrators and extensions</h1>

<p>The following are higher level tools that augment mountebank with additional functionality.</p>

<div>
    <ul class='bullet-list'>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/DevTestSolutions/TestDoubles'>TestDoubles</a> by CA Technologies extends
        mountebank by adding cluster support, named REST APIs, persisted request/response pairs, enhanced command
        line interface (CLI), with packaging mechanisms including Node.js, Docker, Vagrant, PM2 etc.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h1>Build Plugins</h1>

<p>Since <code>mb</code> is another process to manage during your build, having a plugin for your build tool is handy.
If you have a plugin, please add it to this page or let me know about it.</p>

<div>
  <ul class='bullet-list'>
    <li>Grunt: <a href='https://github.com/bbyars/mountebank-grunt'>grunt-mountebank</a> (Extracted from
    the mountebank source)</li>
    <li>Gradle: <a href='https://github.com/ndrwdn/mountebank-gradle'>mountebank-gradle</a> (Andrew Dean)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Build Plugin Implementation Notes</h2>

<p>As of v1.4.3, <code>mb</code> writes the pidfile (mb.pid by default, although it can be overridden on the
command line) only after it has fully initialized, including binding to the socket and initializing any
imposters passed in a config file.  You can use this fact to wait for the pidfile creation before returning
from a build task to guarantee initialization before the next task runs.</p>

<p>Also note that the command to actually run mountebank can vary depending on both the platform and the installation
package.  To support all options, you will need to dynamically determine the executable command to run.</p>

<p>See the <a href='https://github.com/bbyars/grunt-mountebank/blob/master/tasks/mb.js'>grunt-mountebank code</a>
that mountebank uses for its build for an example.</p>
