<p>This patch release resolves another security vulnerability unearthed by the amazing
    <a href='https://github.com/dcRUSTy'>dcRUSTy</a>.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class='bullet-list'>
    <li>Previously, CORS was enabled for all origins, which created a CSRF vulnerability that would allow
    a malicious site to potentially execute remote code through JavaScript injection. Now, CORS is disabled
    by default, requiring you to pass all safe origins on the command line to enable it. Use the new
    <a href='//<%= host %>/docs/commandLine'><code>--origin</code></a> CLI flag to pass in safe origins.</li>
    <li>Ensure <code>numberOfRequests</code> is reset to 0 when sending a <code>DELETE</code> request
    to <code>/imposters/:port/savedRequests</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='windows-path-limitations'>Windows path limitations</h2>

<p><sup>*</sup>mountebank wishes very much for your Windows experience to be hassle-free, but he is simply not qualified to address
    a particular constraint of Windows Explorer.  For legacy reasons, some Windows applications, including most notably Windows Explorer,
    have a maximum number of characters allowed in a path of 260 characters.  As mountebank writes these words, the longest path he
    includes in the zip files is around 175 characters.  The zip file name, which is likely to represent itself as <i>two</i>
    nested directories if you use the defaults to unzip it, will be around 25 characters.  That gives you very little wiggle room.
    If you unzip the file in your users directory, you may very likely get an error because of this constraint.</p>

<p>The following solutions will all work:</p>

<ul class='bullet-list'>
    <li>Unzip to the root of your C: drive (or a similar small path)</li>
    <li>Use <a href='http://www.7-zip.org/'>7zip</a> to unzip the file instead of Windows Explorer</li>
    <li>Use <code>npm</code> to install mountebank instead of the zip file</li>
</ul>
