## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of mountebank. I sincerely appreciate your efforts
and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Please report security bugs by emailing me directly at brandon.byars@gmail.com.

Following your report, I will investigate and keep you informed of the progress towards
a fix and full announcement. Along the way, I may ask for additional information or
guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the
[Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).

## Disclosure Policy

In most cases, I will include a full disclosure in the release notes for the release
that fixes the security bug.
